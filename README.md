# To-do App

I'm working on a basic To-do app, for study! 🎉

Currently it saves data to Local Storage, you can switch between light and dark mode. It is also fully responsive (at least, I hope so!)

If you encounter any problems or have any feedback, I'd love to hear about it. Thank you!

## Overview

This is still a WIP. I'm currently working on the remove buttons and the checkboxes, so they can work without any issues.

Currently I'm using splice() to manage the array, but, although it works on a visual level, the array itself is not registering everything properly. I will keep working on it! 💪🏽
